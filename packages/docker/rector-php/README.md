# About

This image provides the most recent [rector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector) in a docker image.

## Why ?

I needed a way to provide [rector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector) on demand and cross platform (Linux/maxOS/Windows).

=> That's exactly what a Docker image can do :-)

# Usage

@TODO: add usage documentation

See [rector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector) homepage for all options.
